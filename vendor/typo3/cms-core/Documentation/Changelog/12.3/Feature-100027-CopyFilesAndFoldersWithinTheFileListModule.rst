=====================================================================
Feature: #100027 - Copy Files and Folders within the File List module
=====================================================================

See :issue:`100027`

Description
===========

With TYPO3 v12.2, the feature to drag+drop files and folders between the tree
structure was added. Now it is also possible to copy or move resources within
the actual file listing (tile view or list view) into e.g. a different subfolder
by selecting them, and using the mouse to drop them on to a target folder.

Impact
======

TYPO3 file list is now fully usable with drag+drop between the tree and within
the listing itself.

All features make it easier for editors to manage and organize the digital
assets used within TYPO3.
